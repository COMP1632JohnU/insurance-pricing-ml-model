## üí° Overview

This project demonstrates a supervised machine learning model developed to **predict insurance product prices** using key customer and policy features.  
The model was created as part of my MSc research in *Big Data & Business Intelligence (2020)*, where it achieved a **Distinction**.

The study explored how data-driven models can enhance pricing precision and underwriting efficiency in the insurance sector, integrating analytical rigor with business intelligence principles.

## üß© Project Objectives

- Build a predictive model for estimating insurance product prices  
- Compare the performance of multiple algorithms (e.g. Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Evaluate accuracy, error margins, and business interpretability  
- Recommend data-driven insights for improved risk-based pricing
